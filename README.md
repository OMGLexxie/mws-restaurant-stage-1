## Prerequisites

Browser support for JavaScript ES5 and ES6, HTML5, and CSS3 are required

Utlizes Python to run server locally.

The following browsers support this app:
Google Chrome,
Microsoft Edge,
Mozilla Firefox,
Safari

## Instructions

Download or clone the main repo. Unzip the file if necessary and navigate to the project folder. From the terminal, use the following instructions to run the server locally.

1. In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
